# Allied-MasterComputer

This is an AI model replicating the villain AI from *"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"*, a post-apocalyptic short story by American writer **Harlan Ellison**, released in **1967**.  
The story is set against the backdrop of **World War III**, where a sentient supercomputer named **AM**, born from the merging of the world's major defense computers, eradicates humanity—except for five individuals it keeps alive to torture for eternity.
